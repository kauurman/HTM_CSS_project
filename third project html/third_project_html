                        An essay describing certain events that happened to you or other people is called an event essay. 
                        It doesn’t matter if the situation you’re writing about happened to you or not since your overall task does not change. 
                        This task can be a challenging one.
                        You need to include the illustrative details of the event to make the readers feel like they’re experiencing the event firsthand.
                        It needs to be more than a mere description of an event and contain elements of the narrative style.
